[A chaotic fusion of dreamcore and breakcore, blending hazy, nostalgic synth pads with frantic, glitched-out drum breaks. A dense wall of shoegaze guitar, saturated in reverb and distortion, creates a vast, atmospheric soundscape. This ethereal texture is violently interrupted by heavy, chugging metalcore riffs and blast beats. Ethereal, whispery female vocals, delivered in a hypnotic, spoken-word style, float ethereally over the chaotic instrumentation, creating a stark, surreal contrast.]

[genre: experimental metal, atmospheric breakcore] [style: dreamcore, shoegaze, metalcore] [mood: surreal, chaotic, melancholic, empty] [vocals: female, whisper, spoken word, ethereal delivery]

[intro]
[Sound of a music box winding down, static]

[verse]
Porcelain house, silence on every floor
I'm a doll with no seams, dust on my lips so sore
A smile frozen still, my glassy stare
World beyond the glass — a blurred discharge of air
Watercolor fog where nobody's there
Only drops on the windows knock: "What for?"
My voice — a cassette, chewed-up noise
And empty echo from abandoned thoughts

[chorus]
Empty... space...
Walls... like lace...
Somewhere... some place...
No way to retrace...

[interlude]
[Distorted guitar wall of sound rises, followed by a sudden, frantic breakcore drum pattern]

[verse 2]
And thoughts are dust motes in a slowed-down day
Dancing in a beam on the cold wall's grey
Album on my lap, faded garden inside
Feelings are just photos that look behind
Nobody will answer, and I won't ask
Touching with my fingers this silence...
I breathe...
Or maybe it's just a draft along the seams
Splitting my world in half...in half it seems...

[chorus]
Empty... space...
Walls... like lace...
Somewhere... some place...
No way to retrace...

[outro]
[Heavy metalcore breakdown with atmospheric synths fading out, ending in static]

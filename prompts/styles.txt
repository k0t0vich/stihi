Funk Rock with a raw, dry, live-band sound. 
The mix is dominated by a melodic, complex slap-bass, high in volume. 
Guitar is sparse, funky, percussive with a clean or slightly crunchy 
tone and wah-wah effects. Drums are a tight, powerful funk-rock
 groove with a cracking snare. The vocal is a dynamic
  baritone: delivering sharp, rhythmic, rapped verses
   that transition into soaring, warm, and anthemic
    melodic choruses. The vocal performance is 
    raw and passionate, with frequent shifts 
    into a smooth falsetto, energetic ad-libs,
     and a tone that is both vulnerable and confident.

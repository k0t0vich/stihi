Um deine Suno-Skills auf das nächste Level zu bringen, beachte diese Tipps:
Verwende [Intro], [Verse], [Bridge] und kreative Tags wie [Bass Drop]
oder [Whispering Vocals], um die Struktur des Songs gezielt zu
gestalten.
Wenn du GANZE ZEILEN IN GROSSBUCHSTABEN mit ! oder ? schreibst,
verändert sich oft die Stimme – sie wird lauter, glitchiger oder
emotional intensiver.
Beschreibe Sounds in eckigen Klammern, z.B. [Fute Solo Intro] oder
[Crescendo], um Stimmung und Dynamik zu steuern.
Füge eine Story oder Szenenkontext hinzu, z.B. „“80s prom night”“ oder
“lost in Tokyo”, um den Ton und die Emotionen zu lenken.
Baue Effekte mit Bindestrichen ein, wie – gunshots – oder – crows noise
–, um gelegentlich einzigartige Momente auszulösen.
Ersetze gesperrte Wörter durch phonetische Alternativen, z.B. „die“ →
„dye“.
